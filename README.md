# FeedStat-Analyzer
FeedStat Analyzer is a Python-based toolkit for parsing, processing, and analyzing feed view logs. It demonstrates practical data engineering patterns using real log datasets, with a focus on reproducibility, modular design, and professional development workflows. The project uses Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration and result sharing.

Key Python Concepts Demonstrated

File I/O with Context Managers – Safe and efficient reading/writing of data using with open(...).
Data Serialization – Storing structured data with json and csv modules.
Iterators & Generators – Processing log lines lazily to reduce memory usage for large datasets.
String Manipulation – Parsing timestamped log lines with methods like split() and strip().
Error Handling – Robust parsing with try/except blocks for malformed or incomplete data.
Notebook-Driven Development – Organizing analysis in Jupyter Notebooks for reproducibility and collaboration.

Notable Tools & Libraries
JupyterLab – Interactive, notebook-based development.

IPython – Enhanced interactive Python shell within notebooks.

NumPy – Numerical operations for aggregated log metrics.

Pandas – DataFrame-based log processing and analysis.

Pygments – Syntax highlighting in rich-text outputs.
